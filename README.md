## Backend Structure

### `app.py`
  - Add all the needed functions for MangoDB 
  - Login functions by using dex 
  - GET, POST, DELETE, PATCH apis for the comments 
  - Everything will save to the database including the articles and their corresponding articles 
  - Publisher POST article 
  - Moderator DELETE article and APPROVE article 
  - Fetch Approve articles for all users 
  - Get pending articles for moderator
  - Fetch Unapproved articles for publisher and moderator (pending will display)

  - Comment is an object contains    
    - "article_id"
    - "text"
    - "user": the user name 
    - "redacted_text": if the moderator do it or not 
    - "parent_id": if it contains a parent reply 

  - Article is an object contains 
    - "headline": the headline 
    - "abstract": the abstract 
    - "section_name": the section that the article belong to 
    - "body": the main content 
    - "byline": author of the article 
    - "multimedia": images of the article 
    - "approved": approve by moderator or not, all the NYT articles are default approved 

    - For publishing and fetching articles, the logic is as following: 
      - For the publishing: publisher publish a new article -> on hold for the moderator to approve -> moderator approve -> everyone can see it; if moderator not approve, it will be deleted. 
      - For fetching articles: include both fetch unapproved articles (article['approve'] = False) and fetch approve articles (article['approve'] = True), NYT articles are always article['approve'] = True. 
      - Fetch unapproved articles only for publisher and moderator, fetch approve articles for everyone.
